# Planets
A solar system that includes SQL databases in python and MySQL Server

This project was made for a school project near the end of the course. It includes a slightly altered Solar System model in Turtle Graphics created by Jean Joubert at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7bksWvkjtM.
The rest of the project was entirely made by me, which includes a made up planet image
